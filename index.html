    <h3>an early (not-very-polished) prototype of an entry for the 2022 7-Day Roguelike Challenge</h3>

    <p>the idea is a magic-themed deckbuilding game where your mana is represented by a hand of cards with the various types of mana (and you can upgrade your deck by getting cards that give more mana, and get better spells, and so on)</p>

    <p>use <code>WASD</code> or <code>HJKL</code> or arrow keys to move; <code>P</code>/<code>N</code> or <code>[</code>/<code>]</code> to change targets, <code>&gt;</code> to go down stairs, and the number keys to cast spells (healing will heal yourself; attack spells will target whichever enemy is highlighted)</p>
